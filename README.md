# iHUNGRY - Food Pick-up Ordering App
=========
### Midterm project for [Lighthouse Labs](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs) Immersive Web Development Bootcamp.

A food ordering experience for a single restaurant. Hungry clients of this fictitious restaurant can visit its website, select one or more dishes and place an order for pick-up. They will receive a confirmation message when their order is placed and when it is ready for a pick-up.


The restaurant and client both are both notified since this app serves as an intermediary.
Every time an order is placed the restaurant receives a notification via SMS.


A modern telecomm API service Twilio is used to implement SMS communication from the website to the client and restaurant.
